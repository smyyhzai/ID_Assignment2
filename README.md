# black tag - an e-commerce shopping website

This is an e-commerce website that allows users to shop for clothings. They can create an account to save their cart to view at a later time. Users can also collect points and exchange for rewards with their account.

## Design Process

-Our target audience are mostly teenagers who want to shop for clothes, and enjoy their shopping experience. The points that they collect encourages our customers to continue purchasing from our shop. This reward system is engaging and interactive, attracting more teenagers to shop from black tag.

### User stories

- As a teenage customer, I would like to shop for cheap and affordable clothings that looks fashionable within my budget. The reward system implemented allows me to save more money as well. This shop caters well to teenagers and students who are on a tight budget, as compared to other shops that does not offer this reward system.

- This shop makes shopping fun as we get to earn points as we shop. There is also a spin-the-wheel function that allows us to exchange these points for rewards. This makes us motivated to shop more from this shop to unlock more rewards.
